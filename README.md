A Foundry-based development fork of StarkEx core.

# Getting Started

## Requirements

In order to run the tests and deployment scripts you must install the following:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) - A distributed version control system
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) - A toolkit for Ethereum application development.

Additionaly, you should have [make](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/make.1.html) installed.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/threesigmaxyz/threesigma-starkex-contracts
cd threesigma-starkex-contracts
make all
```

## Testing

To run all tests execute the following commad:

```
make test
```

Alternatively, you can run specific tests as detailed in this [guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/tests).

# Deployment

The deployment script performs the following actions:

- Deploys the StarkEx core contracts;
- Deploy and initialize the main proxy contract;

## Local Deployment

By default, Foundry ships with a local Ethereum node [Anvil](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/anvil) (akin to Ganache and Hardhat Network). This allows us to quickly deploy to our local network for testing.

To start a local blockchain, with a determined private key, run:

```bash
make anvil
```

Afterwards, you can deploy to it via:

```bash
make deplo blockTime=10
```

The `blockTime` parameter sets the mining interval, which means that a new block will be generated in a given period of time selected (in seconds).

# Security

This repository includes a Slither configuration, a popular static analysis tool from [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/). To use Slither, you'll first need to [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [install Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither#how-to-install).

Then, you can run:

```sh
make slither
```

And analyse the output of the tool.
